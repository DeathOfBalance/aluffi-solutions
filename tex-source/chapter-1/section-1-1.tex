\subsection*{Problem 1.1.1: Basic Set Operations}
Consider the sets $A = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid 0 < x \le 5\}$ and $B = \{x \in \mathbb{N} \mid x \text{ is even and } x < 10\}$.
Determine $A \cup B$ and $A \cap B$.

\begin{solution}
First, let's list the elements of each set:
$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ (integers strictly greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5)
$B = \{2, 4, 6, 8\}$ (natural numbers that are even and less than 10)

Now, we find the union:
$A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8\}$

And the intersection:
$A \cap B = \{2, 4\}$
\end{solution}

\subsection*{Problem 1.1.2: Number Systems - Classification}
Classify the following numbers as rational or irrational:
a) $\sqrt{9}$
b) $\pi$
c) $0.333\dots$
d) $\frac{1}{7}$

\begin{solution}
a) $\sqrt{9} = 3$. Since $3$ can be written as $\frac{3}{1}$, it is a \textbf{rational number}.
b) $\pi$ is a non-repeating, non-terminating decimal, so it is an \textbf{irrational number}.
c) $0.333\dots = \frac{1}{3}$. Since it can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, it is a \textbf{rational number}.
d) $\frac{1}{7}$ is already in the form of a fraction of two integers, so it is a \textbf{rational number}.
\end{solution}
