\section{Group objects in categories}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define all the unnamed maps appearing in the diagrams in the definition of group object, and prove they are indeed isomorphisms when so indicated. (For the projection $1 \times G \to G$, what is left to prove is that the composition
          \[ 1 \times G \to G \to 1 \times G \]
          is the identity, as mentioned in the text.)

    \item Show that groups, as defined in \S1.2, are `group objects in the category of sets'. [\S10.1]

    \item Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group, and suppose $\circ: G \times G \to G$ is a group homomorphism (w.r.t. $\cdot$) such that $(G, \circ)$ is also a group. Prove that $\circ$ and $\cdot$ coincide. (Hint: First prove that the identity with respect to the two operations must be the same.)

    \item Prove that every abelian group has exactly one structure of group object in the category $\mathsf{Ab}$.

    \item By the previous exercise, a group object in $\mathsf{Ab}$ is nothing other than an abelian group. What is a group object in $\mathsf{Grp}$?
