# Chapter 1: Basic Set Theory and Numbers

Here are the solutions for Chapter 1 of Aluffi's Algebra: Chapter 0.

## Section 1.1: Foundations

* [Solutions for Section 1.1 (PDF)](/aluffi-solutions/assets/solutions/chapter-1_section-1-1.pdf)
    * *Note:* The PDF name is `chapter-1_section-1-1.pdf` because the workflow flattens `aluffi-tex-source/chapter-1/section-1-1.tex` to `chapter-1_section-1-1.pdf` and we excluded the `TEX_ROOT` prefix.

## Section 1.2: Advanced Topics

* [Solutions for Section 1.2 (PDF)](/aluffi-solutions/assets/solutions/chapter-1_section-1-2.pdf)

**Important Notes for Links:**

* **`/aluffi-solutions/`**: This is your `baseurl` from `_config.yml`. It's essential for all internal links to work correctly on GitHub Pages.
* **`assets/solutions/`**: This is the subfolder within your Jekyll site where the PDFs are copied by the GitHub Actions workflow.
* **`chapter-1_section-1-1.pdf`**: This is the *flattened name* of the PDF generated by the workflow. Make sure this matches the actual PDF names generated.

**C. Adding `chapter-1.md` to your Jekyll site's navigation (Optional but Recommended):**

To make this `chapter-1.md` page discoverable, you might want to add it to your Jekyll site's navigation. Open `docs/_includes/header.html` (or a similar navigation file in your chosen Jekyll theme) and add a link:

```html
<nav>
  <a href="{{ '/index.html' | relative_url }}">Home</a>
  <a href="{{ '/chapter-1/' | relative_url }}">Chapter 1 Solutions</a>
  </nav>
